# Telegram Bot
This project is aim to create tg bot that will make real my wishes. I want try automate my life and this bot will help me

## How to start
I recommend create a python `venv` and install needed packages into your `venv`

Create directory `data` and file inside `users.json` which will store all users
```
mkdir data; cd data; touch users.json
```

Also you should create `config.py` and put YOUR Telegram TOKEN inside through the `BOT_TOKEN`, `LOGIN`, `PASSWORD` variables

## Running
> I start my programm this way, but first activate your `venv` by ```source venv/bin/activate``` and enter the directory `src`
```
clear; python bot.py
```
